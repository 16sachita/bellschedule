# Bell Schedule

A (much needed) clean bell schedule web application for Harker students

## Usage
* Go to [the Github IO page](http://iluvredwall.github.io/bellschedule/) to access the schedule
* Click the left and right arrows to switch between weeks
* Periods are highlighted as the day progresses
* Time left until the current period is over is displayed in small, bold text underneath the general period title

## To Do
* doge mode
* ~~options~~
 * **options for intercept f5/ctrl-r**
 * update checking (offline too)
  * Done but needs integration with options
 * **option for passing periods**
 * ~~dynamically update with time setting/disable~~
* "back to this week" button
 * Make it hide when it is week 0 (the current week)
 * Switch away from buttons
* **current task: Parse PDF files for bell schedules and automatically update schedule**
 * Fix PDF Parser (test with correct formatting and modify code)

* Click the left and right arrows to switch between weeks
* Periods are highlighted as the day progresses
* Time left until the current period is over is displayed in small, bold text underneath the general period title

## To Do
* doge mode
* options (save in localStorage)
* ~~intercept f5/ctrl-r~~
* update check (offline too)
* ~~passing periods~~
* dynamically update with time setting/disable
* "back to this week" button
 * Make it hide when it is week 0 (the current week)
 * Make CSS prettier?
 * Change it from button type to backgrounded text? (Makes it easier to hide?)
* **current task: options (update timer interval)**
* **current task: Parse PDF files for bell schedules and automatically update schedule**
